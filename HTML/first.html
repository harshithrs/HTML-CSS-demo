                    <p id="bb">
                        Walter White was an only child. Walt's father died of Huntington's disease when he was six years old. 
                         He studied chemistry at the California Institute of Technology, where he conducted research on proton radiography
                         that helped a team win a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1985. After graduate school, Walt founded 
                         the firm Gray Matter Technologies with Elliott Schwartz (Adam Godley), his former classmate and close friend.
                        Around this time, Walt dated his lab assistant, Gretchen (Jessica Hecht). He left both Gretchen 
                        and Gray Matter Technologies, selling his financial interest in the company for $5,000.
                         Gretchen and Elliott later married and made a fortune, much of it from Walt's research.Though they
                        remain friendly, Walt secretly resents both Gretchen and Elliott for profiting from his work.

                        At the age of 50, Walt works as a high school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, New Mexico, 
                         providing instruction to uninterested and disrespectful students.The job pays so poorly 
                        that Walt is forced to take another job at a local car wash to supplement his income, 
                        which proves to be particularly humiliating when he has to clean the cars of his own students.
                        Walt and his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) have a teenage son named Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte), who has 
                        cerebral palsy. Skyler is also pregnant with their second child, Holly, who is born at the end of season two.
                        Walt's other family includes Skyler's sister, Marie Schrader (Betsy Brandt); her husband, Hank (Dean Norris),
                        who is a DEA agent; and his mother, who is never seen.
