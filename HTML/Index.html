        <p>   A chemistry honors graduate of the California Institute of Technology,<br>
            Walt cofounded the company Gray Matter Technologies with his close friend Elliot Schwartz and his then-girlfriend <br>
            He left Gray Matter abruptly, selling his shares for $5,000; soon afterward, the company made a fortune, much of it from his research. <br>
            Walt subsequently moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he became a high school chemistry teacher.<br>
            Breaking Bad begins on Walt's 50th birthday, when he is diagnosed with Stage IIIA lung cancer.
             After this discovery, he resorts to manufacturing methamphetamine and drug dealing to ensure his family's financial security after his death.
             He is pulled deeper into the illicit drug trade, becoming more and more ruthless as the series progresses, and later adopts the alias "Heisenberg". <br>
